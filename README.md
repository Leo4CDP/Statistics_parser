# Statistics_parser
The scripts for downloading and transforming statistical data

This script is part of script systems to get and tranform Eurostat data to needed formats.
Script to convert xml Eurostat files to csv format.

Description:
Download the xml files from Eurostat to folder "Download/"

Ghe parser checks the number of the files and their names.
1) The files info is compared to file versions.csv.
In versions.csv we storage:
- name of the file
- m:Extracted 
If this file is already executed before, then we don't do the second parsing.
If the file is new (not included to versions csv or m:Extracted  is newer that in versions.csv), we add data on vercions.csv.
!!!! Version.csv is later used to orginise necessary downloads from Eurostat.

2) Accourding to the type the files are transformed to csv format.
